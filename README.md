## Features

- **Subdomain Enumeration** : Automatically discovers subdomains for a given domain using the `sublist3r` library.
- **Directory Scanning** : Checks for accessible directories on discovered subdomains using a custom wordlist.
- **Multithreading** : Utilizes Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel scanning, reducing execution time significantly.
- **Protocol Support** : Supports multiple protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SMB, LDAP, RDP, and SSH.
- **Proxy Support** : Allows users to configure HTTP/HTTPS proxies for anonymity or bypassing restrictions.
- **Logging** : Provides detailed logs for debugging and monitoring the scanning process.
- **Result Saving** : Saves discovered directories into separate text files for each subdomain in an organized folder structure.

## Installation

To use **SubDirScanner** , you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the tool:

1. **Clone the Repository** :

```
  git clone https://github.com/vulnquest58/SubDirScanner.git
```
```
    cd subdirscanner
```
    
2. **Install Dependencies** :
    
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
Alternatively, install the required libraries manually:

```
    pip install requests sublist3r validators
```
    
3. **Prepare Wordlist** : Create a wordlist file (`wordlist.txt`) containing potential directory names. You can also download pre-made wordlists from sources like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) .

## Usage

Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts:

```
python subdirscanner.py
```

### Input Prompts:

4. **Domain** : Enter the target domain (e.g., `example.com`).
5. **Wordlist Path** : Provide the path to your wordlist file (e.g., `wordlist.txt`).
6. **Number of Threads** : Specify the number of threads for parallel scanning (e.g., `10`).
7. **Request Timeout** : Set the timeout for each request in seconds (e.g., `5`).
8. **Proxy Configuration** : Optionally configure HTTP/HTTPS proxies for anonymity.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Scan

```
python subdirscanner.py

- Enter `example.com` as the domain.
- Use `wordlist.txt` as the wordlist file.
- Set `10` threads and a timeout of `5` seconds.

```
### Example 2: Using Proxies

```
python subdirscanner.py

- Enter `example.com` as the domain.
- Use `wordlist.txt` as the wordlist file.
- Set `10` threads and a timeout of `5` seconds.
- Configure proxies:
    - HTTP Proxy: `http://proxy.example.com:8080`
    - HTTPS Proxy: `http://proxy.example.com:8080`

```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of **SubDirScanner** by modifying the following parameters:

- **Protocols** : The list of supported protocols is defined in the `PROTOCOLS` constant. You can add or remove protocols as needed.
- **Timeout** : Adjust the request timeout value to suit your needs.
- **Logging** : Logs are generated using Python's `logging` module. You can modify the log level or format in the script.
